"""Hand-rolled Remez exchange: the minimax polynomial for a weighted error.

Find P of degree n - 1 (n coefficients) on [a, b] minimizing

    max |w(v) (f(v) - P(v))|

The optimum *equioscillates*: the weighted error reaches ±E at n + 1 points,
alternating in sign (Chebyshev's alternation theorem). Remez finds those
points by iterating:

  1. reference: n + 1 points, initially Chebyshev extrema on [a, b]
  2. solve      P(v_i) + (-1)^i E / w(v_i) = f(v_i)  for P and the level E
                -- forces the error to alternate ±E on the reference
  3. extrema    find where the actual weighted error peaks (dense grid,
                one peak per sign-run, alternating)
  4. exchange   those peaks become the new reference; stop when the largest
                peak is within tol of |E| (the grid locates peaks only to
                about its spacing, so tol much below 1e-6 isn't reachable)

Everything is f64. The polynomial is solved in s = (v - a) / (b - a) on
[0, 1] to keep the system well conditioned, then converted back to
monomials in v.
